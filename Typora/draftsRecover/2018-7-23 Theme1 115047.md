Gauss Elimination $\to$ reduce to upper triangular form

Back Substitution $\to$ solve augmented form

## Process of Gauss Elimination

In an $n \times n + 1$ augmented matrix

$R_j - \frac{a_{j1}}{a_{11}}R_i \to R_j$ 

the $\frac{a_{j1}}{a_{11}}$ is referred to as the multiplier, $m$, and $a_{11}$ is referred to as the pivot.

Which yields an upper triangular matrix with the same solution as the original matrix.

Backward substitution is performed as follows:

$x_i = \frac{a_{i, n+1} - \sum_{j=i+1}^{n}{a_{ji}x_j}}{a_{ii}}, i = n - 1, n - 2, ..., 2, 1$

> Gauss Elimination is the procedure of generating a sequence of augmented matrices

### Pivots

* Row interchange required when any of the pivot elements $a_{kk}^{(k)} \ne 0$ 
  * $R_k$ \<-> $R_p$

### Round off error

Example: $\frac{\frac{14}{0.030}- \frac{60}{1.3}}{13 - 2\pi}$ 
$= \frac{470-46}{13-6.3}$
